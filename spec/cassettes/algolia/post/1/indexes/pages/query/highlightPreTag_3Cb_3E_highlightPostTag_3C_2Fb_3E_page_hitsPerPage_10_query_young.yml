        people aged 15-18 in full-time education. The sample was weighted to be representative
        of age, gender, regional make-up and education. The report focuses on: </p><ul><li>The
        current state of financial education and its delivery in schools and colleges

        education:</strong> Most students (58 per cent) did not receive any form of
        financial education – indicating little improvement from previous surveys.
        Fewer girls (36 per cent) than boys (45 per cent) received financial education,
        and those aged 17-18 were less likely to than those aged 15-16. Economics,
        PSHE, Maths and Citizenship are the main subjects for the delivery of financial
        education, but more students are learning financial education through Maths
        and Citizenship following its inclusion in their curricula.</li><li><strong>Financial
        confidence and behaviour:</strong> 80 per cent of students name their parents
        or family as their prime source of financial understanding, with mothers generally
        seen as “better” with managing household finances than fathers. In areas where
        financial education is more widespread students are less likely to be reliant
        on parents for gaining understanding. While half feel they have the knowledge
        to manage their own money, 61 per cent report money worries. A lack of financial
        education is leading to unrealistic expectations - most believe they will
        earn far more than the national average by the age of 30.</li><li><strong>Findings
        in the context of APPG recommendations:</strong> More students are receiving
        financial education through Maths and Citizenship than previously, and very
        few rely on banks for financial education. Seven per cent see teachers as
        a source of financial education and two per cent talk to teachers about money.
        There are marked differences in the provision of financial education between
        regions and countries of the UK, and fewer girls than boys receive financial
        education at school. While a strengthening of the provision of financial education
        in schools is required, there is however an emerging culture of personal financial
        understanding among teenagers, and financial education appears to improve
        teenagers’ confidence and understanding where it is delivered. Overall there
        has been progress in financial education in schools but there is more to do.\n</li></ul><h2

        </strong>The survey notes that it is a ''snapshot''. This short report gives
        little specific detail about the methodological approach and while it tracks
        some changes over the three surveys (with figures) no details are provided
        about the previous surveys. The assertion that financial education appears
        to have an impact is based on regional correlations and do not definitively
        show a cause and effect; the report does call for a longitudinal evaluation

        Despite the limitations, the report offers a good overview of provision, views
        and behaviours that could be the basis for further research. There are useful

        leaving their parental home, moving into the world of work and beginning to
        build a family. But for young people today the challenge is even more difficult
        because they must do all of this in the midst of a struggling economy.</p><p>The
        financial climate, including recession, government spending cuts and structural
        problems such as the high cost of housing are impacting on young people and
        it is possible that the current generation of young people in the UK will
        be the first since the second world war to fare worse in economic terms than
        their parents. </p><p>Those on low incomes, in insecure employment or not

        that would help them deal with emergencies.\n</p><h2 id=\"the-study\">The

        per cent of young people believe their financial prospects are worse than
        their parents’ when they were young compared to just over a quarter (28 per
        cent) who thought that their own prospects were better</li><li><strong>Financial
        resilience: </strong> If they became suddenly unemployed, over half (55 per
        cent) of survey respondents said they would make ends meet using savings,
        but answers to other questions suggest most have savings significantly below
        the minimum level recommended in case of financial emergencies by financial
        advisers (three months of post-tax income). Less than one-third of respondents
        had £3,000 or more – the level of savings that would be appropriate for an
        after-tax income of £12,000 a year, roughly equivalent to gross earnings of
        £14,000 (around 25th percentile of the income distribution). The concern is
        that without an effective safety net young people are more likely to turn
        to short-term or doorstep lenders who charge high rates of interest.</li><li><strong>Influences
        on savings behaviour: </strong>Key influences include the unaffordability
        of saving given the rising cost of living; spending and saving priorities
        (including prevailing culture around debt and spending):  family influence;
        financial literacy and education and upbringing; and the type of savings products
        available.</li><li><strong>Recommendations to improve the financial resilience
        of young people:</strong> </li><li>=When local authorities become responsible
        for providing crisis loans, they should require young people to participate
        in coaching to reduce the likelihood of future loans. </li><li>=The government
        should make contributions into Junior ISAs (or bringing back Child Trust Funds)
        and introduce a new life-course savings account with an incentive that matches
        savings up to a certain level. </li><li>=Policymakers should make a positive
        case for asset-based welfare policies, particularly those that focus on giving
        young people a better start to their working life, in conjunction with developing
        the concept of financial citizenship.</li><li>=The Money Advice Service (MAS)
        should develop a campaign targeted specifically at young people to explain
        the basic financial products they will require during their lifetime.</li><li>=There
        should be an overhaul of financial education – in conjunction with the MAS
        campaign – to ensure that all 16 to 18-year-olds are literate in basic financial
        acumen. </li><li>=Financial providers, particularly banks, money advice organisations
        and voluntary bodies, should take a more proactive approach to promoting saving.

        qualitative research </strong>- five focus groups with a total of 23 young
        adults.</li></ul><h2 id=\"key-findings\">Key findings</h2><p>Key factors that
        affect young adults’ ability to manage money day-to-day, to plan ahead, and
        to negotiate difficulties can be grouped under 1) Goals and planning 2) Financial
        Confidence 3) Engagement and barriers to engaging young adults.</p><ul><li><strong>Goals
        and Planning:</strong></li><li>=Young adults can be put into three groups,
        namely: Planners, Drifters and Dreamers, who approach money management differently.
        Planners have financial goals that are supported by plans, they save more
        and are feel more financially confident. Dreamers have financial goals, but
        no plans and are less confident and tend to be anxious about the future. Drifters
        are the least likely to have financial goals and plans, have little confidence
        with their money and tend to be the most dependent on family financial support.
        </li><li>=Young adults were both more likely to have financial goals over
        the next five years (69%) and to have plans to achieve those goals (41%) (compared
        to all adults aged 18+). However, planning in the main tended to be focussed
        on the achievement of short-term goals and ‘save to spend’ planning - sometimes
        down to a ‘you’re only young once’ attitude. </li><li><strong>Financial confidence:
        </strong></li><li>=There are a number of factors that influence young adults’
        financial confidence including age, gender, education, financial dependency
        and financial goals and planning. Young adults have the lowest levels of financial
        confidence compared to other age groups; only 45% rated themselves as ‘very
        confident’ (compared to 58% of all adults aged 18+) and females rated themselves
        as less confident then males.</li><li>=Financial confidence grows not only
        with age, but also through learning from positive and negative experiences
        and exposure to a range of financial products and decision-making. </li><li><strong>Engagement
        and barriers to engagement:</strong></li><li>=Where young people go for financial
        advice was influenced by financial confidence. For example, financially confident
        young adults were more likely to consult professional sources. However, for
        all young adults the main trusted source of information and guidance on financial
        matters was parents and family. Beyond this, particularly drifters did not
        know where to go for financial guidance. Peers were consulted, but mostly
        around shared financial experiences, such as comparing insurance for holidays.
        Banks were mentioned as another source of information, but they were also
        often mistrusted and perceived as “self-serving”.</li><li>=Young adults are
        more likely to be over-indebted compared to other age groups, but less likely
        to seek debt advice. There are a number of reasons for this, such as thinking
        that things will improve in the future; that they will be able to overcome
        this on their own (particularly amongst men), plus the assumption that one
        needs to pay for financial advice. </li><li>=Self-advising using the internet
        was common amongst all groups, particularly the use of Google. Yet, many young
        people felt overwhelmed by the quantity of information.</li></ul><p>The report

        id=\"points\">Points to consider</h2><ul><li><strong>Relevance:</strong> This
        timely research highlights many relevant challenges and opportunities for
        young adults in the UK.</li><li><strong>Generalisability:</strong> This study
        looks at young adults across the UK aged 18-24 in particular and can therefore
        not be generalised to other groups. However, some of the specific findings
        are likely to apply to older adolescents (16-18). For example, young people
        who live with their parents often remain financially dependent on family.
        </li><li><strong>Applicability:</strong> The study results can be used by
        organisations working with young people to understand how they are perceived
        and what young adults need help with. It offers a wealth of practical advice
        for helping young people to increase their financial capability, and suggests
        opportunities for established organisations to improve the effectiveness of
        their work.</li><li><strong>Methodological strengths or limitations:</strong>  The
        fact that this study uses a mixed method approach is a real strength as it

        people still face a worrying gap between school maths and real-life maths","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"<p><strong>Thursday
        20th October 2016</strong>\n\nYoung people still face a worrying gap between
        school maths and real-life maths, says charity as it unveils new approach
        to hooking 16-25 year-olds into maths through the medium of gaming.\n\nSchool
        maths is leaving too many young people unprepared for the workplace and for
        running their lives, according to the education charity, National Numeracy.
        The charity is calling for changes that ensure all teenagers learn to apply
        maths in practical contexts and see the relevance of it to their lives.\n\nNational
        Numeracy says there is now a compelling body of evidence to support new approaches
        to school and college maths. It cites:\n\n- The mismatch between the two-thirds
        of young people who pass GCSE maths at A*-C and the less than one-quarter
        who demonstrate practical maths skills at the same level;</p><p>- Findings
        from a 2016 YouGov opinion poll showing nearly half (47%) of 18-24 year-olds
        who took GCSE (or equivalent) maths felt it did not prepare them for managing
        their money and over a third (36%) of those who work felt it did not prepare
        them for their current job;\n\n- OECD data showing England as one of very
        few countries where on average young people do no better at maths than the
        over-55s;\n\n- The low pass rate (fewer than one in five) among 17-year-olds
        obliged to re-take maths GCSE.\n\nIn its recent submission to the House of
        Commons education committee’s enquiry into the purpose of education, National
        Numeracy argued that while GCSE maths prepared young people reasonably well
        for advanced maths, it failed to equip many of them for life and work in the
        broadest sense. Although maths has become the most popular A-level subject,
        there is no evidence of a significant shift among those at the other end of
        the achievement range – the young people who struggle with GCSE, who display
        poor functional numeracy and lack mathematical confidence. The charity believes
        that the government’s current review of functional skills presents real opportunities
        – if handled well – to improve maths post-16, but believes that functional
        maths also needs bringing into school pre-16.\n\nNational Numeracy makes its
        demands for changes to school maths as it launches its own novel approach
        to hooking in young adults who lack confidence in maths, showing them how
        maths pervades the real world and helping them to improve their skills.\nIt
        has produced a free new mobile app – Star Dash Studios – a runner game based
        in a virtual film set. Players find themselves on their first day as a runner
        with a challenging to-do list, and as they run through the various departments,
        they meet more experienced members of the crew, each with jobs that need their
        help involving numeracy. The action is fast and furious, the problems are
        highly visual and engaging, and the whole experience is served up with a large
        dollop of humour.\n\nAlthough first and foremost a game (aimed at 16-25 year-olds)
        and not a formal education resource, the app encourages players to think mathematically
        and use everyday numeracy to tackle embedded number problems (relating to
        time, money, percentages, measurements, angles and estimation) – and so move
        up to the next level, an essential feature of gaming. It also offers the option
        of linking to the online National Numeracy Challenge, which lets people assess
        and improve their numeracy skills.\n\nNational Numeracy believes that its
        approach – ‘maths by stealth’ in a gaming app for young adults – is unique.\n\nStar
        Dash Studios draws on academic work showing a correlation between gaming and
        mathematical behaviour and is based on National Numeracy’s own ‘Essentials
        of Numeracy’ model. It is the result of a collaboration between the charity’s
        maths education specialists and award-winning games developers Plug-In Media,
        in consultation with young job-seekers, apprentices and further education
        students. Voice-over is by comedian and writer Chris Kendall.\n\nNational
        Numeracy chief executive Mike Ellicock said: “All the evidence shows that
        too many teenagers feel disengaged from school maths and don’t see its relevance
        to their future lives. We urgently need to crack this problem – and that means
        a better thought through approach to functional maths, in order to build young
        people’s confidence, interest and practical skills.\n\n“It’s against this
        background that we have developed our new app. This is the perfect medium
        for persuading young people that numeracy is part of every job – whether that’s
        on a film set, in an office or on a building site.\n\n“What’s more, the resilience
        everyone needs to improve at everyday maths is akin to the resilience demanded
        by gaming. Persistence pays in both. Try again – and you go up a level.”\n\nThe
        new app is backed by TV presenter and mathematician Rachel Riley. She said:
        “Gaming is a great way to get kids thinking mathematically - without labouring
        the point. And Star Dash Studios brings in maths in an exciting context -
        it’s the maths that you really might encounter working on a film set. If this
        app can build young people’s confidence and start to make them realise that
        maths is something they have to do in everyday life, and something they can
        do, then that’s a great achievement.”\n\nStar Dash Studios can be downloaded
        for free from Google Play, Amazon and App Store from October 20. Its development
        has been funded through a grant from the Ufi Trust and it will be exhibited
        at the Skills Show at the NEC in Birmingham next month.\n</p>","published_at":null,"objectID":"/en/articles/young-people-still-face-a-worrying-gap-between-school-maths-and-real-life-maths","_highlightResult":{"title":{"value":"<b>Young</b>

        study is designed to contribute to a better understanding of issues related
        to the level of financial literacy in New Zealand. In particular, the study
        explores New Zealanders’ experience of financial education and its contribution
        to their financial literacy. While the study builds on previous studies in
        New Zealand and around the world, its approach differs by taking a cohort
        of young New Zealanders and following them over a 20-year period at five-yearly
        intervals. This longitudinal element is unique in the New Zealand context,

        Zealanders aged 18-22 years.\n A baseline survey of participants’ financial
        literacy and experience of financial education has been undertaken. This stage
        of the study collected data in two ways: an online questionnaire and face-to-face
        interviews. Participants were drawn from the New Zealand electoral rolls on
        a national basis but with some regional clustering for practical reasons.

        is a relatively low level of financial knowledge compared to studies in other
        countries.</li><li>Young New Zealanders lack opportunities for formal financial
        education to assist their development of sound personal financial management
        skills.</li><li>Based on responses to an online questionnaire and interviews,
        it is evident that young New Zealanders are exposed to informal financial
        education, such as the promotions undertaken by the Commission for Financial
        Literacy and Retirement Income in relation to credit card debt, and that this
        is having an impact although individuals may not recognise the influence.</li><li>Parents
        remain the key source of informal financial education for young New Zealanders,
        although in some cases the parents’ own personal financial knowledge may be
        limited, restricting their ability to provide the knowledge required by their
        children.</li><li>Young New Zealanders often know the key elements of good
        financial management, such as the need to save, but may not be putting it
        into practice.</li><li>Young New Zealanders are scared of debt, particularly
        in the form of credit cards.\n</li></ul><h2 id=\"points\">Points to consider</h2><p><strong>Methodological

        and female bias to the sample and that no attempt has been made to ensure
        the sample is demographically representative in terms of gender, age or ethnicity.
        There is likely to also be a self-selection bias in the sample, because those
        more interested in the study subject and those with a higher level of self-motivation
        are more likely to have agreed to participate in the study. This bias is stronger
        due to the low response rate, but the effect of the bias is unknown.</li><li>Looking
        forward, a cohort of 300 is a small sample size for a long-term longitudinal
        study.</li></ul><p><strong>Relevance: </strong></p><ul><li>This is an interim
