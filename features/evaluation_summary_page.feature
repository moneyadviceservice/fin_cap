Feature: Evidence Hub: Evaluation Summary page
  As a fincap user
  I want to be taken to a page that contains all the information relating to insight summaries
  So that I can read, analyse and learn about the insight

  Scenario: Evaluation Page
    Given I entered into the "Evaluation" page "Looking after the pennies"
    Then I should see the evidence summary content
