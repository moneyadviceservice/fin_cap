Feature: Evidence Hub: Review Summary page
  As a fincap user
  I want to be taken to a page that contains all the information relating to review summaries
  So that I can read, analyse and learn about the review

  Scenario: Review Page
    Given I entered into the "Review" page "Raising household saving"
    Then I should see the evidence summary content
